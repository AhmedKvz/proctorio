**_UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM_**

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
   I have to make the new npm package, already have the name and the version. I will not use any json server, I think it's better to do deep copy of json object, so there is no risk of altering json file
   Use async function to retrive data from JSON.
   Also, there should be exported function with a list of all employees and their salaries ascendig or descending based on a salary/
   I have to refactor the existing code and develop npm module locally / I have to make a test script to run it locally.

2. # What are the inputs that go into the problem?

   Domain, new promise, resolve, reject, getSalaries, getEmployees

3. # What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
   json server up and runing
   Package returning list of employees with their salaries

**_BREAK IT DOWN_**

# explicitly write out the steps you need to take

1. Init git and publish this in repository on Github

2. How to create npm package locally?!

3. npm init out of src file

4. setup the version and the name of the package json file

5. index.txt convert to normal js file

6. refactor the code of index.js, and make sure to export the function you need to export

7. index.html file for testing import type:module

**Solve or simplify**

# package test locally solved with npm link and another test script

**Refactor**
